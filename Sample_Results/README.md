# Assignment 0 - distributed in Github Repo e4040-2020Fall-assign0
The assignment is distributed as a jupyter notebook called Assignment 0.ipynb from a github repository. Additional instructions and support material for the assignment can be found in file README.md which comes with the assignment and in a set of webpages under https://ecbme4040.github.io/2020_fall/index.html. The assignment uses TensorFlow version 2.2.

The simplest way to initially see the content of the jupyter notebook file Assignment 0.ipynb is to use Google Colab in the cloud: (i) Use your UNI@columbia.edu account to log into the Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb); (ii) Upload Assignment 0.ipynb, explore and run the file.

For students who are formally registered into this class at the end of the add/drop period, the assignment requires that students complete the tasks from this Jupyter Notebook while running it on the **Google Cloud (GCP) custom image** (not Colab, Colab is only a temporary execution method).

# Detailed instructions how to submit this assignment/homework:
1. The assignment will be distributed as a github classroom assignment - as a special repository accessed through a link
2. A students copy of the assignment get created automatically with a special name - students have to rename per instructions below
3. The solution to the assignment has to be submitted inside that repository as a "solved" Jupyter Notebook
4. Three files/screenshots need to be uploaded into the directory "figures" which prove that the assignment has been done in the cloud


## Screenshots for illustrating/documenting that the assignment was done in the Google cloud
In folder "figures", the instructors provide 3 screenshots as an example that shows that the assignment 0 is done in the Google Cloud.<br>
1. a screenshot showing that a VM instance is running under the project **ecbm-UNI**.
2. a screenshot showing that a jupyter notebook is running in the instance under envTF22.
3. a screenshot showing that assignment 0 file, with the IP address on top of the browser.


Students must upload three similar screenshots in the same directory, but with the modified names - add UNI in front of the file names
1. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_1.png
2. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_2.png
3. UNI_gcp_work_example_screenshot_3.png

## (Re)naming of the student repository (TODO students) 
INSTRUCTIONS for naming the student's solution repository for assignments with one student:
* This step will require changing the repository name
* Students MUST use the following name for the repository with their solutions: e4040-2020Fall-assign0-UNI (the first part "e4040-2019Fall-assign0" will probably be inherited from the assignment, so only UNI needs to be added) 
* Initially, the system will give the repo a name which ends with a  student's Github userid. The student MUST change that name and replace it with the name requested in the point above
* Good Example: e4040-2019Fall-assign0-zz9999;   Bad example: e4040-2020Fall-assign0-e4040-2019Fall-assign0-zz9999.
* This change can be done from the "Settings" tab which is located on the repo page.

INSTRUCTIONS for naming the students' solution repository for assignments with more students, such as the final project. Students need to use a 4-letter groupID): 
* Template: e4040-2020Fall-Project-GroupID-UNI1-UNI2-UNI3. -> Example: e4040-2020Fall-Project-MEME-zz9999-aa9999-aa0000.
