# Insurance-Product-Lists-with-Web-Scraping-
Generate lists weekly to track newly launched/ discontinued product in the insurance market

Method:

1. First part: Extract information from the web 
The program extract all the names of products available from the site of the targeted insurance company; 
it then export the information into seperated csv files according to the category of insurance (ex. life/ health/ accident/ annuities/ group insurance, etc) with the inputed date added at the end of the name of the csv files

2. Second part of the program: Compare lists 
The program can compare product lists of two designated dates(ex. all types of insurances of 20170730 vs those of 20170722 ) and produce outcomes of what new products had been luanched (i.e newly posted on the site) within the period and what had been discontinued (i.e no longer on the site)
